I created a class-based, Tkinter-based program that uses 
EventBasedAnimationClass to create a simplified, local,
2-4  version of the classic game Settlers of Catan
that uses mouse clicks to operate. 

If you have Python 2.78 downloaded, and 
eventBasedAnimationClass, which was given by Kosbie and 
is included in the project folder, all you have to do is 
click on the file SettlersOfCatan.py to get the game 
started.

Please read the final project explanation in the design
folder included in this folder for more information about
how I created this game and how it works.
